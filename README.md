# Australis Dark Dev-Ed

The purpose of this project is to provide a Firefox Developer Edition theme with curved Australis tabs. Currently, it is implemented as a Stylish css theme.

TODO: Add userstyles.org link here once it's stable enough for release.

The current implementation copies a lot of code from devedition.css, and then it adds custom implementation for the curved tabs. Another possible way to approach it is to start from a Developer Edition theme, and then customize the CSS for the curved tabs.

The benefits of the latter approach is that we essentially get platform-specific implementation for free. Whereas currently, the implementation only works for Windows 10. Will explore this further.
