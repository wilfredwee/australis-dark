# Australis Dark Dev-Ed

The purpose of this project is to provide a Firefox Developer Edition theme with curved Australis tabs. Currently, it is implemented as a Stylish css theme.

**TODO:** Add userstyles.org link here once it's stable enough for release.

There are 2 files in this project: from-default.css and from-dev.css

from-default.css is the original implementation and should be deprecated soon. It transforms the default Firefox theme to Australis Dark.
from-dev.css transforms the Dev Edition theme to Australis Dark. On Firefox Stable release, this addon needs to be installed and the Developer Edition theme needs to be enabled: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/devedition-theme-enabler/

Transforming from Dev Edition is better because we get the platform-specific css for free.

**TODO:** Test on Linux.
